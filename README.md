# Android_Interfaces_Java

### Instructions

This assignment will have you write a set of classes which will inherit from a combination of interfaces. It would be easiest to do this in intellj, but you can use Android Studio if you prefer.

## Requirements

1. Build two interfaces, `AirTravel`, `WaterTravel` and `GroundTravel` with methods for `fly`, `sail`, and `drive`
2. Write a single base class called `Vehicle` with an abstract method called `travel`
> None of these methods will accept or return anything, they will just print out what they are doing and how. The how is imporant, ie the helicopter class will "fly with rotors" the airplane will "fly with wings" the rocket will "fly with fire"

3. Write 6 classes that inherit from the base class and implement a single or combination of interfaces. The travel method for each class will call the appropriate implemented method(s)
4. The main method will create a list of Vehicles and call travel on each of them
